:package: patch v0.0.2

```
Add support for inquirer.js module. It enable this module to suggest alternative readings when the section can not be found.
Updated global npm modules directory lookup to reduce the depth to 0. I hope that will make it faster.
Add capability to locate a package by its path. So you can do `showusage ../my-local-pkg`.
```
